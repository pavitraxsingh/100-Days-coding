100 Days of Code – C Programming Challenge

This repository documents my 100 Days of Code journey focused entirely on C programming. The challenge is organized into multiple branches, each covering a 10-day segment for clean and structured progress tracking.

Objective

Build strong fundamentals in C programming

Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Practice writing efficient and clean C code

Work on programs, exercises, and mini-projects

Maintain consistent daily coding habits for 100 days

Branch Structure

Each branch represents a 10-day block of progress:

day01-day10

day11-day20

day21-day30

day31-day40

day41-day50

day51-day60

day61-day70

day71-day80

day81-day90

day91-day100

Each branch contains:

Daily C programs

Practice problems

Notes/documentation

Mini C projects (where applicable)

Guidelines

Code in C for at least 1 hour every day

Commit daily work to the appropriate branch

Document concepts learned and problems solved

Maintain clean, structured, and well-commented code

Topics Covered

Throughout the challenge, I will focus on:

Basics of C (variables, data types, operators)

Control statements (if-else, loops)

Functions and recursion

Arrays, strings, and pointers

Structures, unions, enums

Dynamic memory allocation

File handling in C

Preprocessor directives and macros

Data structures (linked list, stack, queue, etc.)

Mini-projects in C

Repository Contents

Daily code files (C programs)

Practice exercises

Problem-solutions

Notes & explanations

Small projects to apply concepts
